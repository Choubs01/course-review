This is me reviewing and recounting some of the courses I've done.  


## PY4E
This course sucked so much. I think I first started late 2021 or very early 2022. The section concerning beautiful soup destroyed me 3 times over. First time I did the 
course and reached the BS part and couldn't figure out why the code was working after spending a week on it, I sacked the course for a few months. Repeated this process a 
couple times over. It was in September 2022 when I finally figured it out. I ran pip install for bs4, then checked what directory it was installed to, then extracted the
folder to where I write my code.  

Anyhow, the course wasn't very good. Perhaps in the beginning it was good, but Chuck just isn't a very good instructor, I'd even say he's bad but that would be mean
considering it's all free. But he just glosses over so much stuff and every now and then he would explain these really advanced concepts that were totally meaningless. 
I remember his lessons about object oriented programming, those went over my head completely, I understood close to nothing. The assignments weren't all that good. At the
start they were, but as the course went on the assignments didn't get harder but easier. The final project was nothing more than downloading a few files, writing literally
two words in my case, then just running them and taking a few screenshots.  

I'd recommend for the first some 7 lessons.

## INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE AND PROGRAMMING IN PYTHON
This was a very good course, would recommend. My only complaints are that they should've done a bit more on classes and their syntax. The other problem is that the final 
problem set is outdate, but it still works well just short of actually running. It can be fixed though I reckon, wouldn't know how though.  

Would definitely recommend.
